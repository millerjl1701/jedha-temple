Administration of Galaxy Infrastructures with Puppet
====================================================

### Introduction

Administering Galaxy infrastructures can be a daunting task. Configuration management allows one to implement infrastructure using code as opposed to checklists and HowTo guides in order to have reliable installations and the ability to replicate an installation.

Building off of the work started at the GCC2017 Hackathon, this training will introduce the idea of using puppet for configuration management of systems using existing puppet code and other open source tools available that augment puppet. This session requires no prior experience with puppet or other configuration management tools.

### Prerequisites

* You have setup a Galaxy instance beforeâ€¦ maybe.
* Knowledge and comfort with the Unix/Linux command line interface and use of a text editor.
* Vagrant with puppetlabs/centos-7.2-64-nocm box available or a CentOS 7 virtual machine (Infrastructure Server group install).
* No Puppet, Chef, or Ansible experience is required.

### Tentative Outline of Topics

1. Introduction to Puppet (Hopefully presented by a PSE from Puppet since we are in Portland)
1. Demo/hands on work to bring up a Galaxy instance using vagrant.
1. Breakdown of individual modules and how to use them to customize the Galaxy installation
1. ????
1. Profit!
